[Organization Process]
The idea of this talk is to FORMALIZE the BRAINSTORMING process

[When?]
1. Before Prototyping
2. After Prototyping
3. After feedback
4. After testing

[Explanation]
Stage 1:
1. Explain the goal even if everybody knows
2. Explain Process, main questions
   - Let them know, you have total freedom to explore all territories
   - No worries, more is better. Filtering comes next

Stage 2:
[Laws of BrainStorming]
1. No criticism
2. You are not trying to solve the problem
3. Don't interrupt anyone
4. Write down everything, not just the title.
    (i.e. Tower defense + turtle towers, are the turtle the towers?)

Stage 3:
[Roles]
1. Designate a facilitator (leader) responsabile of
    - Understand and explain the problem
    - Aim of the brainstorm session
    - Encouraging ideation and discouraging criticism
    - Ensure that no voices are lost during discussion (call people not involved enought)
    - Encourage people join ideas together (thinking together vs alone)
    - Encourage synthesis of ideas
    - His role isn't to identify the best solutions
2. Resignate a secretary responsible of:
    - Record every idea
    - Monitor duration of the session
    - if possible, participate in brainstorming
    - Shows the ideas in a huge panel so everybody can see
    - His role isn't to qualify each idea, just report
3. These roles swaps so everybody can participate

Stage 4:
[Begins the session]
1. Keep a Casual Spirit atmosphere
2. Start with a bad or worthless idea 
  (The stupider the first idea, the confident to speak)


Stage 5:
[Feedback coming]
1. Positive feedback ALWAYS  
  (zero negative feedback, you want to lower defenses)
2. The wilder/crazy idea the better. 
  its easier to scale down an unfeasible idea rather than Expanding on simple ideas
  (shoot for the moon)
3. From unfeasible to scaled down
4. Rework unfeasible ideas (Best approach) vs   

Stage 6:
[Rework]
1. Build on ideas. Combine, transform
2. Exploration of each idea
3. Expaning on simple ideas
4. Rework unfeasible ideas
5. REINFORCE, positive loop makes ideas wilder

Stage 7:
[End loop]
1. Quantity matters

Stage 8:
[Filtering Session]
1. Problems should be simple
2. Divide Complex problems
3. Brainstorm each subproblem
4. Problems should be simple and easily articulated

Output:
  -> Brainstorming leads to Prototyping

Form groups:
    - Everybody stands up. As you form groups of 6, sit down
    
    
 After the process:
    1. Starting with empty words (Volcano, stairs) and getting into the idea
    2. What's a theme what an idea
    -who's your game character, what's your character game set
    3. Oh that's cool, lets talk more about that thing
