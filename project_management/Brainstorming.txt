[Organization Process]

[Explanation]
Stage 1:
1. Explain the goal even if everybody knows
2. Explain Process, main questions
   - Let them know, you have total freedom to explore all territories
   - No worries, more is better. Filtering comes next

Stage 2:
[Laws of BrainStorming]
1. No criticism
2. You are not trying to solve the problem
3. Don't interrupt anyone
4. Write down everything, not just the title.
    (i.e. Tower defense + turtle towers, are the turtle the towers?)

Stage 3:
[Begins the session]
1. Designate a facilitator and secretary
2. Keep a Casual Spirit atmosphere
3. Start with a bad or worthless idea 
  (The stupider the first idea, the confident to speak)


Stage 4:
[Feedback coming]
1. Positive feedback ALWAYS  
  (zero negative feedback, you want to lower defenses)
2. The wilder/crazy idea the better. 
  its easier to scale down an unfeasible idea rather than Expanding on simple ideas
  (shoot for the moon)
3. From unfeasible to scaled down
4. Rework unfeasible ideas (Best approach) vs   

Stage 5:
[Rework]
1. Build on ideas. Combine, transform
2. Exploration of each idea
3. Expaning on simple ideas
4. Rework unfeasible ideas
5. REINFORCE, positive loop makes ideas wilder

Stage 6:
[End loop]
1. Quantity matters

Stage 7:
[Filtering Session]
1. Problems should be simple
2. Divide Complex problems
3. Brainstorm each subproblem
4. Problems should be simple and easily articulated

Output:
  -> Brainstorming leads to Prototyping
