PMBOOK:
  Waterfall model
  
AGILE:
1. Envision
    How: Meeting
    What: Customer Vision for the product
    
2. Speculate
    - Translate vision into features
    - Design features
    - Each feature is broken down to stories
    - Plan for these features
3. Explore
    - Accepting features
    - Release plans and iterations plans
    - User testing
4. Adapt
    - Evaluate, Take action
    - Product functionality
    - Product Quality
    - Team Performance
    - Project Status
5. Close
    - Capture lessons learned


Methodologies:
  - SCRUM
  - LEAN
Tools:
  - Kanban
  - Feature driven development (FDD)
  - Extreme programming (XP)
  - Dynamic System Development Method (DSDM)
  - Crystal


AGILE LEAN (from manufactory to software):
    Optimize customer value, minimice waste.
    - Create more value for customers for lower resources
1. Eliminate Waste
2. Amplify Learning
3. Decide as late as possible
4. Deliver as fast as possible
5. Environment, team organize themself
6. Build integrity, advertise, deploy, access, how solves the problem
7. See the whole? think big act small, feel fast learn rapidly.

System thinking
- strategic thinking
1. Where we want to be
2. How will we know when we get there
3. Where are we now
4. How do we get there
5. What will or may change in your environent
- Process Control (prediction)
1. Inputs (Today state)
2. The system (throughputs)
3. Output (future)
4. Feedback 
- Empirical Process Control
1. Inspection
2. Adaption
3. Transparency (observed by anyone)
- single loop vs double loop learning
1. single loop learning
    - continuous feedback from the environment
    1. Track & Monitor
    2. Compare to Rules, Strategy Asumptions
      -> Feedback
      <- Adjustments
    3. Reflect & adapt rules
    4. Take appropiate action
2. double loop learning: learning about the learning process


Traditional vs Agile project management
- Focus on plans or artifacts VS focus on customer interaction and satisfaction
- Response to change through corrective, preventive actions VS Change controlled through adaptive adaptation
- Typically up from planning VS Progressive elaboration with release and iterative planning
- Top Down control VS Self organizing and cross-functional teams
- Scope based delivery VS time Boxed delivery
- Contract oriented VS customer orientation

SCRUM
1. Product owner
    - Inputs from Customers, Team managers
    - Prioritized Wish list by business value
    - Maintain product backlog
    - Log requirements
2. Sprint meeting
    - How much it can be commited to deliever
    - Sprint planning
    - Sprint backlog
    - How to implement those features
3. Feature request
    - Broken down into tasks
    - Each task is assigned to a member of the dev team
4. Sprint
    - No changes in duration of deliverables
    - Daily standups. 
        1. What did you do since last meeting?
        2. Do you have any obstacles?
        3. What will you do before next meeting?
5. End of the sprint
    - Sprint review, demonstration of new functionality
    - sprint retrospective, oportunity to identify opportunities to improve
Values of scrum
- Courage to commit
- Respect
- Feedback quickly, defect early
- Communication, reduce noise
- Simplicity


Extreme Programming (XP)
  - Target customer changes
  1. Release plan
  2. Iteration plan
  3. Acceptance Test
  4. Stand-up meeting
  5. Pair negotiation
  6. Unit-test
  7. pair programming
  Try to break the code before going the next feature
  Principles
  1. Small releases
  2. All members use Common names and descriptions
  3. simple design, only necessary code
  4. testing, also customer provides acceptance test
  5. refactoring
  6. Pair programing (same machine)
  - Continous Integration (keep all programs in the same stage in same machine)
  - 40hs/week
  - customer collaboration
  - coding standard

Kanban
  1. TODO | DOING | DONE
  2. BACKLOG | NEW | IN PROGRESS | COMPLETE : Customers
      -> the stages of the feature
 
Crystal
  1. Crystal Clear | Crystal yellow | Crystal Orange | Crystal Red
  2. Team size | System criticality | Project Priorities
  3. Criticallity:
      - L6: Loss of life
      - E6: Loss of essential money
      - D6: Loss of discretionary money
      - C6: Loss of comfort
  4. teams from 3-6 individuals
  5. Focus on people, not processes of artifacts


Feature Driven Development
1. Develop overall model -> object model
2. Build Feature list -> Categorized features list by functionality
3. Plan by future -> A development plan
4. Design by feature -> A design package
5. Build by feature -> A client valued function

Dynamic System Design Method (DSDM)
- Delivery of the business solution rather than just team activity
- Ensure the feasibility of the model
- Stresses cooperation and colaboration
- Make use of prototyping
- Clear picture of the system
1. Preproject
    - Feasibility study
    - Business study
    [Build, Test, Deploy, Support]
2. Functional model
    - Create functional prototype
    - Agree Plan
    - Review Functional prototype
    - Identify funcional prototype
3. Design and build
    - Identify design prototype
    - Review Design prototype
    - Create design prototype
    - Agree plan
4. Implementation
    - Review business aspects
    - Implement
    - Train users
    - User approval & guidelines
6. Iterate
7. Postproject
