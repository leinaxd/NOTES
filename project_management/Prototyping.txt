Low fidelity prototype 1.

[Why paper prototype?]
1. Get Feedback from other people
  - Proof of concept
  - Communicate, set a solid point to start
2. Experiment with Alternatives
  - Catch big problems you are going to deal
3. Easy to change or throw away
    - It has to be disposable and cheap
    
-> Find the small set of rules, who takes the most of the fun
-> Hypothesis, the player answer YES or NOT if the game was good or not

[When?]
1. After Brainstorming


[How?]
1. Define a set of rules
2. The consequences of the design will pop up a bunch of new dynamics

[Testing]
1. Bring in players, test from the start
2. Everybody can contribute to the design of the game (artist, developers)

[Analysis]
1. Shows usability problems
    - A Player has a decision (knows what to do), but has no idea how to execute it. 

[FEEDBACK]
1. Players tend to give more criticism when they see something is clearly incomplete.
2. Deliverately set things that look incomplete, so people will give you more feedback
    (ie. Text Placeholder for cards)
3. Feedback is valuable, but the solutions they give you are not.
    (ie maybe the color isn't the problem maybe the shapes are too small)
    
    
[Tools]
1. Large sheet of paper
    Grided / hex grided
2. Index Cards
  - Write rules
  - Build graphs
3. Dice
4. Post-it
  - Multiple screens
5. pencil, tape, ...
6. Small toys
    -lego, towers
7. Mobile Camera
Warning: Contrained by the tools!


[Team Roles]
- Players
- Computer / Facilitator
    - Present the rules
    - Get the feedback
    - Follow the script (respond accordingly)
    - Encourage the player to think loud, 
      is he confused? 
      is he thinking hard about the problem?
      is he bored?
- Observers
    - Cannot intervene with the player
    - let him play suboptimal, take bad decisions
    
 [Human simulating the backend]
 - Someone plays the computer
 - Very constrained
 - Communication
 - Rules
 - Don't let the player what the computer is thinking
 - The computer only reveals information. It doesn't explains what is it doing
 
 [Player vs Player]
 - People plays together
    - Cooperative / competitive
    - Symetric / Asymetric
 - Very Loose
    - Open Communication
    - Rule Negotiation
  - Facilitator helps explain the rules
  
  [Live action]
  - Predetermined rules
  - Explained before game
  - Loose interpretation and constraints
  - Limited communication 
  - Avatar walks around
  
  [Markers]
  - High Contrast for markers in the game
  - 
  
  [Rules]
  - Write rules on cards
  - Rearrange flow control
  - Update cards as you change rules
  - Periodically take photos
  - Simplify, simplify simplify set of rules
  
  [Quality Loop, Iterative Design]
  1. Question
      - What's this prototye is going to achieve
  2. Rapid design
      - Axiomatic design, things without a question
        (assume a random condition, and player has to identify and anticipate)
  3. Play & test
      - Team & Others
  4. Revise
  5. Repeat
  
  [Changes]
  1. Amend, replace, killing a rule
      - something buggle the game or its too confuse, then take the rule out
  2. Limit/Unlimit
  3. Player interference
  4. Mess with the play order
  5. Variable changes. (attack/defense) Multiply/divide 2
  6. Core and reconstruct
  7. Throw away
  
  [Overfitting & Underfitting]
  1. For a quick project, don't do more than you should
    (Don't apply an effect because its easy or because you can.
     like photoshop, you get lost in the features)
     
       
  -> output:
      design log, problems, changes.
