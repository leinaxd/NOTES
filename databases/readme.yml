# HOW TO CHOOSE YOUR BEST SUITED DATABASE BASED ON THEIR FEAUTURES?
#
# WORKLOADS:
#    1. OLTP. High Performance into individual writting and readings
#    2. OLAP. High Performance into computing aggregates or data analysis
# OPERATOR MODEL: how the query operator gets propagated. (aka Processing model)
#    1. (P)ipeline model. Propagates one tuple at a time.
#    2. (M)aterialization model. Propagates all tables at once.
#    3. (B)atch model. Propagate a batch of tuples at a time.
#
# STORAGE MODEL:
#    1. (N)ormalized (S)torage (M)odel. Many minimal related tables
#    2. (D)ormalized (S)torage (M)odel. Store redundancies in an easy access big table
# ACCESS METHODS: how tuples are readen from disk
#    1. (S)EQUENTIAL (S)CAN
#        OPTIMIZATIONS:
#        1. (P)refetching. Fetching pages from disk ahead of time
#        2. (B)uffer (P)ool (B)ypass. Temporal Buffer pool page
#        3. (P)arallelization
#        4. (Z)one (M)aps. Precomputed aggregates per page.
#        5. (H)eap (C)lustering
#        6. (L)ate (M)aterialization
#    2. (I)ndex (S)can
#    3. (M)ulti (I)ndex (S)can
# PROCESS MODEL: How processes are run concurrently
#    1. (P)rocess per (W)orker. process one worker at a time.
#    2. (P)rocess (P)ool. we have a bunch of processes waiting in a pool, when a client arrives you can attach any free worker in the pool.
#    3. (T)hread per (W)orker. Instead of processes, a single thread per worker
# ISOLATION LEVELS: correctness vs performance with anomalies
#    1. (S)erializable, correctness guarantee
#    2. (S)napshot (I)solation,
#    3. (R)epeatable (R)eads, no dirty reads, no unrepeatable reads, phantom possible
#    4. (R)ead (C)ommited, no dirty reads, repeatable reads problem, phantom problem
#    5. (R)ead (U)ncomitted, dirty reads, repeatable reads, phantom problem.
# MVCC: Multi-version concurrency control
#    1. PROTOCOL
#       1. MV-2PL
#       2. MV-TO
#       3. MV-OCC
#    2. VERSION STORAGE
#       1. DELTA
#       2. APPEND ONLY
#       3. TIME-TRAVEL
#    3. GARBAGE COLLECTION
#       1. VACUUM

#       3. HYBRID
#       4. TXN-LEVEL
#    4. INDEXES
#       1. LOGICAL
#       2. PHYSICAL
# LICENCE:
#    1. (O)pen Source
#    2. (C)ompercial
# ARCHITECTURE: 
#    1. (S)hare (E)verything, single node
#    2. (S)hare (M)emory, one centralized memory
#    3. (S)hare (D)isk, one disk storage, many nodes
#    4. (S)hare (N)othing, many cpu-memory-disk units

# DECISIONS TO SELECT YOUR DATABASE SYSTEM
# 1. How efficiently query data through indexes?
#    - semantic vectors
#    - B+TREE search
#    - Hashing search
# 2. How does your system escalate?
#    - Horizontally (distributed system)
#    - Vertically (increasing hardware, cores, memory)
# 3. Storage Capabilities
#    - Disk Architecture
#    - On memory systems
#    - Cloud architecture
# 4. object type
#    - Does your data fit entirely into a single page size? (long texts)
#    - how to store binary large objects? (images)
#    - How to store time series data?
# 5. How many redundancy replicas
# 6. Can your data expire over time? (purge old records)
# 7. Does your data has to be consistent? (locking protocols)
# 8. Does your data has to be exactly right, or an approximation is also legal?
