# Lecture 2

## Background
Hardware was much different when the original DBMSs were designed
- Uniprocessor CPU
- Ram was severely limited
- The database had to be stored on disk
- Disk were even slower than they are now.

You always want to run databases on new hardware and get the best performance you can get out of it


But the high level of ideas from back then is almost the same, but limitations are not the same.

- Back then machines didn't have machines with a lot of sockets
