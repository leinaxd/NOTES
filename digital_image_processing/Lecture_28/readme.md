# Lecture 28: Digital Image Forensic
We've talked about how image can be manipulated 
- There's a whole generation of legal issues
  
![](1_forensics.jpg)

So How Old is this photograph?
- it was composited 200 years ago
  
![](2_forensics.jpg)

In this image we have the queen of england with the prime minister of canada and in the right her husband the king 1939
- The king was removed and replaced with background

![](3_forensics.jpg)

it could be done by painting over the photograph and taken the photograph over that.


This is Mussolini who looks fearful alone in his horse instead of being asisted

![](4_forensics.jpg)

Same here, the artist were trying to fake those guys so people believe they were together.
- guilt by assosiation

### Digital Image Forensic
- Hany Farid (darhmouth -> Berkeley) is an expert who has written many books

How you can tell if one image was manipulated or not.


- There are some clever Jpeg related stuff you can watch to know if the image was corrupted or not
- Camera Related cues, How do the image gets acquired by the sensor of the camera. Each camera has a unique signature.
- Light and physics related things. (reflection, shadows)


### JPEG Issues
- You take an image
- You divide it into 8x8 blocks
- Then apply DCT you get coefficients
- Then apply a normalization/quantization matrix
- Then Huffman code the result

![](6_forensics.jpg)

Somehow the program who is reading the file, has to know some information about the compression. 
- JPEG has a header which contains:
- How big the image is (resolution)
- Also the Normalization matrix.

![](7_forensics.jpg)


JPEG Header has
- Image dimensions
- Quantization table
  - 8x8 arrays x 3 colors YCbCr channels = 192 numbers
- Huffman code representation (how many codeworks of each length there are)
  - codewords of 1-15 length for each of 3 channels, and x2 (factor of 2) for DC/AC (encode different DC from AC, because DC and AC have different distribution and huffman code looks for same distribution to work)
- JPEG Thumbnail (optional, miniature of the image)
  - it also has its own coding = 192+90 more
- on top of that, there's some EXIF metadata, like aperture for the camera, gps.
  - the metadata can be faked, but a true image usually has more information
  - the distribution of folders or how much information does it contains could be usefull too.
- Each camera has its own metadata, how much to store, how to organize information.

So add up all these header numbers form 576 values that form a signature. Hopefully every camera has a different signature.
- One study of over 9000 cameras, 70% has unique signature.
- Almost 88% has 3 or less in same bin

Each version of photoshop has also a unique signature.

`JPDUMP` an application to read that metadata


### JPEG ghost

How do you want to alter an image
- compiste images, put stuff
- Then save to a jpeg

I alter one region, then stick it back into the original. Two pieces are often compressed with different JPEG parameters / quality / factors.

![](7_forensics.jpg)

This can be revealed by saving the candidate image at different compression level as you approach the quality level of the tampered part, a ghost appear.


Here is some example.

![](8_forensics.jpg)

```
%matlab
function jpegghost(im1)

close all;

b= 16; %block size
q1=90; %JPEG quality for first image
q2 = 60; %JPEG quality for second image (q2<q1)
qrng = [15 : 5 : 90]; %Range of qualities
sz = 500; %size of altered region (in pixels

[ydim, xdim, zdim] = size(im1);

%%% Save to different JPEG qualities
imwrite( im1, 'tmp1.jpg', 'quality', q1);
imwrite( im1, 'tmp2.jpg', 'quality', q2);
%%% Make new image as combination of im1 and im2
im1 = imread('temp1.jpg');
im2 = imread('temp2.jpg');
xrng = round( [xdim/2-sz/2 : xdim/2+sz/2-1] );
yrng = round( [ydim/2-sz/2 : ydim/2+sz/2-1] );
im1(yrng, xrng,:) = im2(yrng, xrng, :); %splice

imwrite(im1, 'temp3.jpg', 'quality', q1);

figure(1);
imshow(im1);
title('original image')

%%% Load altered image
im3 = imread('temp3.jpg')

figure(2)
imshow(im3)
title('altered image')

[ydim, xdim,zdim] = size(im3)

%%% Compute the difference between im3 and jpeg
nQ = length(qrng);
map = zeros(ydim, xdim, length(qrng));

...
```
