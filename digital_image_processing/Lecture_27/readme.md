# Lecture 27: Image Retargeting
Image retargeting is a general category
- Resizing
- Recompositing
- Reshufling
- Inpainting

### Image resizing
For example you want a thumbnail for youtube which is a small image with high density of information
- What if i don't want necessary keep the same aspect ratio?
- The wide screen of the movie theater is not the same of the one for your tv.

![](1_retargeting.jpg)

Suppose i want to make this image squared

![](2_retargeting.jpg)

One possibility is to crop out a square of the image 
- A good thing is i'm not compromising any aspect of the image quality
- The bad news is that you are missing a lot of information
  
![](3_retargeting.jpg)

Another option would be to shrink the image.
- But you are missing the shapes of the objects
  
![](4_retargeting.jpg)

Another common thing to do is letter boxing
- i don't throw anything
- But the padding is a waste of pixels i could use

![](5_retargeting.jpg)


### NON UNIFORM WARPING

A better approach
- Letting the user outline the region of interest into 9 blocks
- Keep the region of interest in proportion
- And the squeeze the other boxs
  
![](6_retargeting.jpg)


![](7_retargeting.jpg)

Different pieces of the image are treated in a fundamental different way.

### SALIENCY
Can we design automatically algorithms to guess where is the region of interest?
- uses studyes of people looking for images and tracking their eyes

For example,
- eyes are attracted to color contrast
- attracted to faces
- attracted to edges


![](8_retargeting.jpg)

Appling the saliency estimator we get the following

![](9_retargeting.jpg)


### Optimized scale and stretch
Another approach is instead of having a single region of interest, applying a map of interest.
- within each rectangle i have a meassure of how important that rectangle is.
- A simple metric is edginess
  
![](10_retargeting.jpg)


So what's the importance of each pixel?
- using the magnitude of the gradient to measure that.

![](11_retargeting.jpg)

The sky elements are more squishable than the ground

![](12_retargeting.jpg)

The boxes are still together, but the algorithm tries to move all of those vertex

![](13_retargeting.jpg)

There's a cost function that says,
- for important boxes make it kind stay a square
- for non important boxes, don't distort them too much


### SEAM CARVING
Suppose you want to make the image skinnier, reducing the number of columns
There are a number of possibilities i can do.
- i can chop columns out of the image
- it can be from the edges, or it can be from the middle
- Each time i remove a column it makes 1 column narrower.

It's a 'non uniform downsampling' technique


But instead of removing columns, i can be removing SEAMS.
- a one pixel wide path, that goes from the top of the image to the bottom
   
![](14_retargeting.jpg)


The trick is choosing a good seam, that when i remove those pixels, the image looks preety the same as before.

The cost function to my seam is related with the gradients.

Seam Energy for seam S 
- Compute the gradient of the image through the seam in both axis

![](15_retargeting.jpg)

IDEA: instead of removing pixels, it can be used to hallucinate new ones?

Then if you want 10 pixels narrower, then remove the 10 low energy seams.

![](16_retargeting.jpg)

So i have a cost function, but how do i minimize that cost function?
- You can do it through DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

I want the seam to be connected, so you have to choose the top 3 pixels for a particular central pixel.


![](17_retargeting.jpg)

The result i get is something like that.
- Note that people are not deleted from the image
- Also the seam is dodging around the seawed on the beach
![](18_retargeting.jpg)

If i remove those pixels then i get an image like that.

![](19_retargeting.jpg)

IDEA: Could the cost function be improved through a machine learning algorithm? 
- Would the algorithm learn which pixels are important?
- Would the algorithm learn how to connect pixels?


I can do the same technique to make images larger.

![](20_retargeting.jpg)

So find the lowest path seeam and add stuff

![](21_retargeting.jpg)

So those are the lowest cost seams

![](22_retargeting.jpg)

The frog has been avoided
- There are some distortions, shadows doesn't match anymore
  
![](23_retargeting.jpg)


### SEAM CARVING for INPAINTING
It can be used to do INPAINTING, that is removing things i don't want.

![](24_retargeting.jpg)

It won't work in this scene, because the books have regular structure
- there's no pixel i can steal


I can tell the algorithm to get rid of that object, 
- i can tweak the algorithm to remove the K seams, that are forced to go through that object
- Then i can resize it, and add K seams to get back the original size


![](25_retargeting.jpg)


![](26_retargeting.jpg)

Removing those seams

![](27_retargeting.jpg)

Then fatten up, to get the original size

![](28_retargeting.jpg)

![](29_retargeting.jpg)


Conversely to protect a region, give it an infinite cost

This algorithm is usefull if you have a web app, then you always have the right size for images even if its mobile.
 
![](30_retargeting.jpg)

![](31_retargeting.jpg)


If you just remove the cheapest columns you get a distorted image

![](32_retargeting.jpg)

If i resize this image, i get several distortion, that's why you might need to protect some areas.

![](33_retargeting.jpg)


![](34_retargeting.jpg)


One thing that can go wrong is
- What makes a good scene is not much of what you remove
- What i should care is what new gradients i'm introducing.

The Original SEAM CARVING looked backward. But Better is to look forward.

What new edges we introduce if we remove the seam?

![](35_retargeting.jpg)

If i'm going to remove these shaded pixels along a seam i'll be generating some new pixels that were now close together that weren't adyacent in the previous image.

Here is a simple case, case 2.
- if i remove the central column, now the rest will become neighbors
- and i should have a cost that says, well, what's the gradient between those 2 new neighbors.
- How much energy i'm introducing into the image by removing those pixels.

So instead, a simple twist is removing those pixels according with the energy that will going to be.

Here is the original image

![](36_retargeting.jpg)

Applied the original seam carving algorithm

![](37_retargeting.jpg)

Applied the backwards seam carving algorithm
