# Lecture 27: Image Retargeting
Image retargeting is a general category
- Resizing
- Recompositing
- Reshufling
- Inpainting

### Image resizing
For example you want a thumbnail for youtube which is a small image with high density of information
- What if i don't want necessary keep the same aspect ratio?
- The wide screen of the movie theater is not the same of the one for your tv.

![](1_retargeting.jpg)

Suppose i want to make this image squared

![](2_retargeting.jpg)

One possibility is to crop out a square of the image 
- A good thing is i'm not compromising any aspect of the image quality
- The bad news is that you are missing a lot of information
  
![](3_retargeting.jpg)

Another option would be to shrink the image.
- But you are missing the shapes of the objects
  
![](4_retargeting.jpg)

Another common thing to do is letter boxing
- i don't throw anything
- But the padding is a waste of pixels i could use

![](5_retargeting.jpg)


### NON UNIFORM WARPING

A better approach
- Letting the user outline the region of interest into 9 blocks
- Keep the region of interest in proportion
- And the squeeze the other boxs
  
![](6_retargeting.jpg)


![](7_retargeting.jpg)

Different pieces of the image are treated in a fundamental different way.

### SALIENCY
Can we design automatically algorithms to guess where is the region of interest?
- uses studyes of people looking for images and tracking their eyes

For example,
- eyes are attracted to color contrast
- attracted to faces
- attracted to edges


![](8_retargeting.jpg)

Appling the saliency estimator we get the following

![](9_retargeting.jpg)


### Optimized scale and stretch
Another approach is instead of having a single region of interest, applying a map of interest.
- within each rectangle i have a meassure of how important that rectangle is.
- A simple metric is edginess
  
![](10_retargeting.jpg)


So what's the importance of each pixel?
- using the magnitude of the gradient to measure that.

![](11_retargeting.jpg)

The sky elements are more squishable than the ground

![](12_retargeting.jpg)

The boxes are still together, but the algorithm tries to move all of those vertex

![](13_retargeting.jpg)

There's a cost function that says,
- for important boxes make it kind stay a square
- for non important boxes, don't distort them too much


### SEAM CARVING
Suppose you want to make the image skinnier, reducing the number of columns
There are a number of possibilities i can do.
- i can chop columns out of the image
- it can be from the edges, or it can be from the middle
- Each time i remove a column it makes 1 column narrower.

It's a 'non uniform downsampling' technique


But instead of removing columns, i can be removing SEAMS.
- a one pixel wide path, that goes from the top of the image to the bottom
   
![](14_retargeting.jpg)


The trick is choosing a good seam, that when i remove those pixels, the image looks preety the same as before.

The cost function to my seam is related with the gradients.

Seam Energy for seam S 
- Compute the gradient of the image through the seam in both axis

![](15_retargeting.jpg)

IDEA: instead of removing pixels, it can be used to hallucinate new ones?

Then if you want 10 pixels narrower, then remove the 10 low energy seams.

![](16_retargeting.jpg)

So i have a cost function, but how do i minimize that cost function?
- You can do it through DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING

I want the seam to be connected, so you have to choose the top 3 pixels for a particular central pixel.


![](17_retargeting.jpg)

The result i get is something like that.
- Note that people are not deleted from the image
- Also the seam is dodging around the seawed on the beach
![](18_retargeting.jpg)

If i remove those pixels then i get an image like that.

![](19_retargeting.jpg)

IDEA: Could the cost function be improved through a machine learning algorithm? 
- Would the algorithm learn which pixels are important?
- Would the algorithm learn how to connect pixels?


I can do the same technique to make images larger.

![](20_retargeting.jpg)

So find the lowest path seeam and add stuff

![](21_retargeting.jpg)

So those are the lowest cost seams

![](22_retargeting.jpg)

The frog has been avoided
- There are some distortions, shadows doesn't match anymore
  
![](23_retargeting.jpg)


### SEAM CARVING for INPAINTING
It can be used to do INPAINTING, that is removing things i don't want.

![](24_retargeting.jpg)

It won't work in this scene, because the books have regular structure
- there's no pixel i can steal


I can tell the algorithm to get rid of that object, 
- i can tweak the algorithm to remove the K seams, that are forced to go through that object
- Then i can resize it, and add K seams to get back the original size


![](25_retargeting.jpg)


![](26_retargeting.jpg)

Removing those seams

![](27_retargeting.jpg)

Then fatten up, to get the original size

![](28_retargeting.jpg)

![](29_retargeting.jpg)


Conversely to protect a region, give it an infinite cost

This algorithm is usefull if you have a web app, then you always have the right size for images even if its mobile.
 
![](30_retargeting.jpg)

![](31_retargeting.jpg)


If you just remove the cheapest columns you get a distorted image

![](32_retargeting.jpg)

If i resize this image, i get several distortion, that's why you might need to protect some areas.

![](33_retargeting.jpg)


![](34_retargeting.jpg)


One thing that can go wrong is
- What makes a good scene is not much of what you remove
- What i should care is what new gradients i'm introducing.

The Original SEAM CARVING looked backward. But Better is to look forward.

What new edges we introduce if we remove the seam?

![](35_retargeting.jpg)

If i'm going to remove these shaded pixels along a seam i'll be generating some new pixels that were now close together that weren't adyacent in the previous image.

Here is a simple case, case 2.
- if i remove the central column, now the rest will become neighbors
- and i should have a cost that says, well, what's the gradient between those 2 new neighbors.
- How much energy i'm introducing into the image by removing those pixels.

So instead, a simple twist is removing those pixels according with the energy that will going to be.

Here is the original image

![](36_retargeting.jpg)

Applied the original seam carving algorithm

![](37_retargeting.jpg)

Applied the backwards seam carving algorithm

![](38_retargeting.jpg)


### Patch based algorithms
Suppose we have a really complicated image, 

![](39_retargeting.jpg)

you will see that using seam carving will immediately go bad. The reason is that there's no low cost seam.

This image has a lot of repetetitive patterns.
- Maybe we should do is keep every part of the image, but get a smaller representation

![](40_retargeting.jpg)


- Suppose you have to resize a building with many windows. maybe you want to squeeze it back and have fewer windows.


 ### Bidirectional Similarity
 - I have an original Image $I$
 - And a retargeted image $I'$

There are 2 principles.
- I' should be **Complete** (should contain as much visual information form I as possible)
- I' should be **Coherent** (No new visual information that wasn't in I)

We don't want to introduce any artifacts

We want to perform a cost function that encapsulate those principles.
- The distance or difference between both images is

![](41_retargeting.jpg)

- I'm going to look to a whole bunch of patches in the original image
- And i find the bset corresponding patches in the new image
- And i compute that average distance

This is the completeness criteria.
- Everything in the old image should be represented in the new image.
- Every patch should be represented in the new image.


The Coherence Criteria
- Take patches in the newly generated image
- and look for best patches in the old original image.

![](42_retargeting.jpg)

So i have 2 directions, and that's why this is called bidirectional similarity.

Patches are blocks of pixels at multiple scales (sizes).

Minimize this cost function is not that simple.

Suppose i want to make the image a little bit smaller, 
- i can initialize the new image with a rescaled version of the original image.
- and then i can refine those pixels intensities to be aligned with my cost function.

Its not that hard to update.

How do i know how much every pixel in the new image contributes to the cost function?


Pixej 'j' is going to contribute to a bunch of patches over there.
- for a 3x3 patches, that pixel is going to contribute to 9 patches
- so i have 9 cost function terms dependent of pixel 'j'
  
![](43_retargeting.jpg)

I don't know which patches over an image I are going to have pixel 'j' in their best matching block.

HOW DOES PIXEL 'j' in I' CONTRIBUTE TO THIS COST FUNCTION?
- it will be a member of $w^2$ w x w patches in I'

And the way this is going to contribute to the cost function is the following.
- for every block it contains that pixel in I'
- there's going to be a best matching block in I
- and then i'm comparing both colors in both positions 


![](44_retargeting.jpg)

If not i'm looking at the other patch in I', there's some other block in I
- and we want to compare

![](45_retargeting.jpg)


Kind of what i have is, 
- the contribution is the sum over all this blocks,
- of some pixel value over image I
- minus a pixel in image I'

![](46_retargeting.jpg)

The other way, which is completeness is less certain

Here is my pixel J in I
- it is possible that it never matches in image I'
- Or it could be indeed matched
- 
![](47_retargeting.jpg)


![](48_retargeting.jpg)

Then the original function was to sum both weights.

Then, to find $I'(j)$ take derivative of D with respect of that pixel and set it equal zero.
- Its going to be a bunch of averages of the original image
- Bunch of terms because the completeness term and a bunch of terms for the coherent term.
- And then some weigthed average.

![](49_retargeting.jpg)


The idea is if knew which blocks do match between the two images it's easy to generate a new color.


The general approach is an Iterative Algorithm to produce I'.
1. Initialize I' with a rescaled version of I
2. Match blocks from I' to I
3. Match blocks from I to I'
4. Update with formula above
5. Iterate 2

Works well but it's time consuming.

### Patch Match
A fast implementation of minimizing this bidirectional similarity cost function.
- you are constantly matching patches which are time consuming.
- A lot of time you don't have to match all patches.
- Sometimes you can approximate those matches.

This approaches enables:
- Resizing an image
- Recomposing
- Reshufling

In this example, it shows that when resizing it preserve the structure removing repetitive windows.
`youtube: Adobe Photoshop CS6 - content aware fill, move, patch`

![](50_retargeting.jpg)


This paper is doing interactive reshufling

![](51_retargeting.jpg)

Move those pixels in there, and fix the image

![](52_retargeting.jpg)


Moving the ceil of that building is like saying those pixels are nailed in I', fixed.
- Then iterate along to reconstruct the rest of the image

You can also copy those pixels multiple times.

![](55_retargeting.jpg)


Can be used to inpainting and remove some person in the image
- so i can also prohibit to use those pixels in image I skipping their patches before going to I'.

![](53_retargeting.jpg)

![](54_retargeting.jpg)


Retargeting, i have some constraints.
- the boundary of the image has to be like maybe 5 or 10 pixels wide window around the original image.
- That fixes some pixels in I'
- and then all pixels have to follow in to make a same size image.

![](56_retargeting.jpg)

Another thing they do is to force those lines to remain in the new image.

![](57_retargeting.jpg)

![](58_retargeting.jpg)

![](59_retargeting.jpg)


You can also force some perspective lines to be fixed, and keep the boy before resizing
- Many of the bottles have dissapeared
  
![](60_retargeting.jpg)

![](61_retargeting.jpg)


It still not fully automatic.

It can also be applied to video.
