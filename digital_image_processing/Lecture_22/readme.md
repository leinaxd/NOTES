# Lecture 22: Fan-Beam reconstruction

Last lecture we've seen how to reconstruct an image from a parallel beam.
- The radiation source is moving in a line
- Parallel beams to each others.

In this lecture we'll reconstruct an image from a fan beam.
- Instead we have a fix radiation source that kind of rotates around the patient.
- Then each beam is projected to a plane
- The patient can also be inside a rotating machine
  
![](1_fan_beam.jpg)

So i can't apply the same equation from last time to this geometry. 
- we will try a combination of change of coordinates and trig identities.


Last time we have discused how to describe that line.
- But this time we are going to parametrize differently
- We are going to define 2 new angles.
- $\beta$ tells me how different is that ray from vertical (As i change the source around the patient i'm changing beta)
- $\alpha$ tells me how far am i from the center line (How spread is the beam)
  
![](2_fan_beam.jpg)

Each beam $\rho(\alpha, \beta) corresponds to some parallel beam $L(\rho, \theta)$

![](3_fan_beam.jpg)

So how to convert to new coordinates?

![](4_fan_beam.jpg)

## Revisiting last time for Filtered Back Projection

![](5_fan_beam.jpg)

Rho was the distance from beam to beam. And it was bounded to a certain width $T$.
And Theta was bounded from 0 to pi. (now we take half integral going to 2pi)

![](6_fan_beam.jpg)

![](7_fan_beam.jpg)

Now what we are going to do is to go from the XY world to polar coordinates.
- remember (x,y) is a fixed pixel in the image

![](8_fan_beam.jpg)

![](9_fan_beam.jpg)

Substituting variables.

![](10_fan_beam.jpg)

Now with a change of coordinates

![](11_fan_beam.jpg)

![](12_fan_beam.jpg)

Now i'm going to give the radon transform a new meaning
- $\alpha_m = sin^_{-1}(\frac{\rho}{D})$ maximum alpha (don't confuse $\alpha_m$ with the variable $\alpha$
- As $\beta$ is periodic, i can choose it's 0-2pi range

![](13_fan_beam.jpg)


Let a point (x,y) in coordinates (r,$\phi$)

![](14_fan_beam.jpg)

Now let the source ray be a distance D perpendicular to that point which is at distance R
- let $\alpha'$ being the angle of that point respect of the source.
- Also draw the perpendicular of that point into the ray axis, it denotes angle $\beta$.

![](15_fan_beam.jpg)

We complete the trigonometric properties

![](16_fan_beam.jpg)

Now lets try to determine distance (1)

![](17_fan_beam.jpg)

Now Lets try to determine distance (2)

![](18_fan_beam.jpg)

Expanding that term we get.. 

![](19_fan_beam.jpg)

Which using the previous analysis we get.

![](20_fan_beam.jpg)

Now the thing to observe is that 
- R and $\alpha$ are both functions of r, $\phi$ and $\beta$

![](21_fan_beam.jpg)

Remember that $S$ was defined as the inverse fourier transform of the window function.

![](22_fan_beam.jpg)

So now what we have is

![](23_fan_beam.jpg)

Now, let's make a change of coordinates.

![](24_fan_beam.jpg)

Plugging into the window formula
- we found that we just got the same window function transform as a function of $\gamma$
  
![](25_fan_beam.jpg)


Putting all together

![](26_fan_beam.jpg)

The idea  is that the inner integral is the convolution with $\alpha$ (beam size) as the dummy variable.
- of the projection for a fixed $\beta$ and a window function $h$


It's a different type of filter back projection.

The outside thing says sum up all of these back projections as they go all around the circle.


Also there's a less accurate way of dealing with fan beam projections.
- you can notice that these beams can be resorted to produce parallel beams.
- so once you have all the data, select those beams who are at certain angle from the detector plane.

![](27_fan_beam.jpg)


Which fan beam correspond to which parallel beam? ($\alpha, \beta)\ to\ (\rho, \theta)$

![](28_fan_beam.jpg)

If fan beams are Equally spaced
- n'th ray in the m'th radial projection, is the same as the n'th ray in the (n+m)'th parallel projection.
  
![](29_fan_beam.jpg)

However there's no guaranteed that the rays that i take are going to be equally spaced.

![](30_fan_beam.jpg)

$\rho$ is not going to be spaced at the increment $\gamma$ 
- so we need to do some interpolation to get all the values of $\rho$ (not an issue is $\gamma$ is small)

### In a modern hospital, there might be other geometries.
Helicoidal geometry
- Instead of slicing the patient one slice at a time.
- The patient is moving to the entrance while the detector is rotating around.

![](31_fan_beam.jpg)


Cone Beam slicing (called generation 7)
- So instead of slicing a cross section, you are taking a cone sample with an horrendous math derivation
- Instead of 1-dimensional detector you have a 2-dimensional detector.
- Then you have to reconstruct the 3D geometry of the patient
