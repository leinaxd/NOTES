# Lecture 16: Boundary, Region Description and Filtering

So far we talked about Finding shapes like Graph cutting, active contours or just playing with thresholding
- They were focused on finding a single shape that we called 'foreground' and trying to separate from the 'background'
- We also talked about Erosion, Dilation, opening, closing to get rid of undesirables objects
- A real life example involves the finding of many shapes like in a petri dish

![](petri_dish.jpg)

We will talk about
- Shape of objects
- Texture of objects
- matlab 'regionprops' (properties of an object)

## SHAPE PROCESSING

![](blob_properties.jpg)

- Perimeter
- Area
- Diameter (the longest path between two points that are on the boundary)
- Bounding Box (smallest rectangle enclosing the object)

Compactness of the blob
- The smallest you can do is a circle
- With the same Area you can increase the perimeter

![](compactness.jpg)
![](circularity)

Centroid or Center of mass.
- Where are most of the pixels locates. (avg of all points)

![](centroid.jpg)

What is the best fit ellipse?
- How to fit the best ellipse in the object
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors tell us the size and orientation of the ellipse

![](ellipse_fit.jpg)

![](eigenval.jpg)

```
#Matlab
[x, y] = meshgrid([-100:100], [-100:100]);
z = (x/5).^2 + (y/3).^2;
im = z < 100;
imshow(im)

r = regionprops(im)
>>> Area = 4689
>>> Centroid = [101, 101]
>>> bounding box = [51, 71, 99, 59]
```

![](ex1.jpg)

Eccentricity of the ellipse
- Circle has ECC = 0
- Line has ECC = 1

![](eccentricity.jpg)

```
r = regionprops(im, 'area', 'eccentricity')
a = [r.Area]
e = [r.Eccentricity]

ind = a > 50 & e<0.4;
find(ind)
```

```
function highlight(bw, ind, im)
r=bw;
g=bw;
b=bw;

if nargin >2
  rim = im(:,:,1)
  gim = im(:,:,2)
  bim = im(:,:,3)
end

if islogical(ind)
  f = find(ind);
else
  f = ind;
end

L = bwlabel(bw);

for i=1:length(f)
  ob = (L==f(i));
  r(ob) = 1;
...
```

```
bwlabel(bw) %Each blob in different color
```

![](ex_2.jpg)
![](ex_3.jpg)

Now show the thing who passed the test

![](ex_4.jpg)

Now we want 
` ind = a > 50 & a <50000 & e<0.7`

![](ex_5.jpg)

Solidity test
` ind = a > 50 & a <50000 & e<0.7 & s>0.7`

# Topology of the Blob
The Euler number counts how many conected components has minus num of holes.

Magnetic Ink character recognition.
- How to design numbers that are easily identificable

## Fourier Series
If a shape is parametrizable, fourier transform can be done.
- Then you can apply low pass filtering

![](fourier.jpg)

Pricipal Component Analysis for shape fitting can also be applied.
- You requiere some training shapes
- Then compute how likely is to observe some shape

![](pca.jpg)


# Shape abstraction
For some branching structure, like for medicine you cannot deal with those shapes
- you can trace a one pixel length skeleton to represent that structure
- i.e. blood vessels

![](blood_vessels.jpg)

If you can extract the skeleton, you could
- Meassure distance between joints

Estimation
1. Successive Erosions until one pixel line
2. Distance transform (Compute the distance between every interior point to the boundary, then your skeleton is where you have your local maxima of that distance)

Medial Axis, Definition: 
- Points that have more than one nearest neighbor
- You can draw circles that sandwich right inside the shape

![](medial_axis.jpg)

Here is a simple example.
- Ussually prunning is required to delete the spurs.
