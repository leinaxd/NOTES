# Lecture 16: Boundary, Region Description and Filtering

So far we talked about Finding shapes like Graph cutting, active contours or just playing with thresholding
- They were focused on finding a single shape that we called 'foreground' and trying to separate from the 'background'
- We also talked about Erosion, Dilation, opening, closing to get rid of undesirables objects
- A real life example involves the finding of many shapes like in a petri dish

We will talk about
- Shape of objects
- Texture of objects
- matlab 'regionprops' (properties of an object)

## SHAPE PROCESSING

![](blob_properties.jpg)

- Perimeter
- Area
- Diameter (the longest path between two points that are on the boundary)
- Bounding Box (smallest rectangle enclosing the object)

Compactness of the blob
- The smallest you can do is a circle
- With the same Area you can increase the perimeter

Centroid or Center of mass.
- Where are most of the pixels locates. (avg of all points)

What is the best fit ellipse?
- How to fit the best ellipse in the object
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors tell us the size and orientation of the ellipse
