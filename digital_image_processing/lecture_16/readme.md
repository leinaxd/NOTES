# Lecture 16: Boundary, Region Description and Filtering

So far we talked about Finding shapes like Graph cutting, active contours or just playing with thresholding
- They were focused on finding a single shape that we called 'foreground' and trying to separate from the 'background'
- We also talked about Erosion, Dilation, opening, closing to get rid of undesirables objects
- A real life example involves the finding of many shapes like in a petri dish

![](petri_dish.jpg)

We will talk about
- Shape of objects
- Texture of objects
- matlab 'regionprops' (properties of an object)

## SHAPE PROCESSING

![](blob_properties.jpg)

- Perimeter
- Area
- Diameter (the longest path between two points that are on the boundary)
- Bounding Box (smallest rectangle enclosing the object)

Compactness of the blob
- The smallest you can do is a circle
- With the same Area you can increase the perimeter

![](compactness.jpg)
![](circularity)

Centroid or Center of mass.
- Where are most of the pixels locates. (avg of all points)

![](centroid.jpg)

What is the best fit ellipse?
- How to fit the best ellipse in the object
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors tell us the size and orientation of the ellipse

![](ellipse_fit.jpg)

![](eigenval.jpg)

```
#Matlab
[x, y] = meshgrid([-100:100], [-100:100]);
z = (x/5).^2 + (y/3).^2;
im = z < 100;
imshow(im)

r = regionprops(im)
>>> Area = 4689
>>> Centroid = [101, 101]
>>> bounding box = [51, 71, 99, 59]
```

![](ex1.jpg)

Eccentricity of the ellipse
- Circle has ECC = 0
- Line has ECC = 1

![](eccentricity.jpg)

```
r = regionprops(im, 'area', 'eccentricity')
a = [r.Area]
e = [r.Eccentricity]

ind = a > 50 & e<0.4;
find(ind)
```

```
function highlight(bw, ind, im)
r=bw;
g=bw;
b=bw;

if nargin >2
  rim = im(:,:,1)
  gim = im(:,:,2)
  bim = im(:,:,3)
end

if islogical(ind)
  f = find(ind);
else
  f = ind;
end

L = bwlabel(bw);

for i=1:length(f)
  ob = (L==f(i));
  r(ob) = 1;
...
```

```
bwlabel(bw) %Each blob in different color
```

![](ex_2.jpg)
![](ex_3.jpg)

Now show the thing who passed the test

![](ex_4.jpg)

Now we want 
` ind = a > 50 & a <50000 & e<0.7`

![](ex_5.jpg)

Solidity test
` ind = a > 50 & a <50000 & e<0.7 & s>0.7`

![](ex_6.jpg)

# Topology of the Blob
The Euler number counts how many conected components has minus num of holes.

![](euler_num.jpg)

Magnetic Ink character recognition.
- How to design numbers that are easily identificable

![](MICR.jpg)



## Fourier Series
If a shape is parametrizable, fourier transform can be done.
- Then you can apply low pass filtering

![](fourier.jpg)

Pricipal Component Analysis for shape fitting can also be applied.
- You requiere some training shapes
- Then compute how likely is to observe some shape

![](pca.jpg)


# Shape abstraction
Idea is to extract the fundamental connectivity of the shape

For some branching structure, like for medicine you cannot deal with those shapes
- you can trace a one pixel length skeleton to represent that structure
- i.e. blood vessels

![](blood_vessels.jpg)

If you can extract the skeleton, you could
- Meassure distance between joints

Estimation
1. Successive Erosions until one pixel line
2. Distance transform (Compute the distance between every interior point to the boundary, then your skeleton is where you have your local maxima of that distance)

Medial Axis, Definition: 
- Points that have more than one nearest neighbor
- You can draw circles that sandwich right inside the shape

![](medial_axis.jpg)

Here is a simple example.
- Ussually prunning is required to delete the spurs.

![](simple_example_1.jpg)
![](simple_example_2.jpg)
![](simple_example_3.jpg)


```
#matlab
bwmorph(BW, 'skel', Inf)
```
![](A.jpg)
![](AA.jpg)

How to get rid of the spurs?
- How many points are connected
- The point at the very end of the spur is also connected to the points of the skeleton
- You incrementally search for points conneted to many points of the skeleton until you find 3 of them

![](simple_example_4.jpg)


This coral is segmented through active contour
- Then `rgb2gray(im)>130` it iss thresholded to be a binary image
- Then `bwfill(bw1,"holes")` to fill out the holes
- Then `bwmorph(bw2, 'skel',Inf)`
- The result still have spurs
![](ex_7.jpg)

![](ex_8.jpg)
![](ex_9.jpg)
![](ex_10.jpg)
![](ex_11.jpg)
![](ex_12.jpg)

So far we talked about Binary images
- But remember that are underlying intensities/colors inside each blob

## Texture 
Texture, can also be filtered 
- Flat
- Noisy
- Stripey
For example with Fourier Analysis...

Another approach is working with the histogram inside each blob!
- mean intensity
- second moment (variance) / contrast
  - Flat  => Var = 0
  - Noisy => Var = High
- Third moment (skewness) (distribution direction to the left/right)
- Entropy (How random, how compressable)

![](std.jpg)
![](skw.jpg)
![](entropy.jpg)

None of these reflect spatial distribution of intensities.

## Gray-Level Co-Occurence Matrix (GLCM)
1. Specify an operator Q (spatial relation b/w 2 pixels)
  - e.g. '1 pixel to the right'

![](GLCM.jpg)

If there are N-Gray levels in the image, then make an $N\times N$ Matrix where
$P(pixel 1, pixel 2 |acording to Q) = (l_1, l_2)$

- an histogram where starting at pixel 1, how often (how many times) you encounter a following 1 (then 1 following 2, etc...)
- The image is $8\times 8$

![](GLCM_histogram.jpg)

if you want actual probabilities divide by $K$

you will have $K$ pixels (number of  possible pixels pairs according to Q)

In practice, number of gray level is quantized (i.e. 8 or 16)
![](GLCM_ex_1.jpg)
![](GLCM_ex_2.jpg)
![](GLCM_ex_3.jpg)

`gl = graycomatrix(im)`

![](GLCM_ex_4.jpg)
![](GLCM_ex_5.jpg)
![](GLCM_ex_6.jpg)

- So a dark pixel is likely followed by another dark pixel, because the variation between bands is gentle
- The real Image is like the random noise image, but near intensities are close to each others.

consider now an offset vector of pixels adjacencies
`off = [zeros(1,20), [1:20]]'`
- how the GLCM changes as a function of the offset that i give.

![](off_vec.jpg)

`g1 = graycomatrix(im1, 'offset', off)`

next we can talk about statistics of this vectors
- Contrast
- Correlation (how predictable is going from one neighbor to the next)
- Energy
- Homogeneity
`s1 = graycoprops(g1)`

i.e. a noisy image we don't expect any correlation
`plot(1:20, s1.Correlation, 1:20, s2.Correlation)
legend('noise', 'sine')`

- The noise image has 0 correlation
- while the sine correlation has a sine correlation of step 24
  
![](noise_sine_correlation.jpg)


In the following example we have the same biscuit but different texture
- There are some correlation in the first bunch of group pixels.
- The further i go, the higher the unpredictibility
- For the second image, i see some pattern predictibility arround 10 pixels

![](correlation_texture.jpg)

![](correlation_texture_2.jpg)

Instead of looking for offsets in the 'x' left-right direction i can change to the up-down direction
- There is no a clear pattern as before in the vertical direction.
