# Lecture 16: Boundary, Region Description and Filtering

So far we talked about Finding shapes like Graph cutting, active contours or just playing with thresholding
- They were focused on finding a single shape that we called 'foreground' and trying to separate from the 'background'
- We also talked about Erosion, Dilation, opening, closing to get rid of undesirables objects
- A real life example involves the finding of many shapes like in a petri dish

![](petri_dish.jpg)

We will talk about
- Shape of objects
- Texture of objects
- matlab 'regionprops' (properties of an object)

## SHAPE PROCESSING

![](blob_properties.jpg)

- Perimeter
- Area
- Diameter (the longest path between two points that are on the boundary)
- Bounding Box (smallest rectangle enclosing the object)

Compactness of the blob
- The smallest you can do is a circle
- With the same Area you can increase the perimeter

![](circularity)

Centroid or Center of mass.
- Where are most of the pixels locates. (avg of all points)

![](centroid.jpg)

What is the best fit ellipse?
- How to fit the best ellipse in the object
- Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors tell us the size and orientation of the ellipse

![](ellipse_fit.jpg)

![](eigenval.jpg)

```
#Matlab
[x, y] = meshgrid([-100:100], [-100:100]);
z = (x/5).^2 + (y/3).^2;
im = z < 100;
imshow(im)

r = regionprops(im)
>>> Area = 4689
>>> Centroid = [101, 101]
>>> bounding box = [51, 71, 99, 59]
```

![](ex1.jpg)

Eccentricity of the ellipse
- Circle has ECC = 0
- Line has ECC = 1

![](eccentricity.jpg)

```
r = regionprops(im, 'area', 'eccentricity')
a = [r.Area]
e = [r.Eccentricity]

ind = a > 50 & e<0.4;
find(ind)
```

```
function highlight(bw, ind, im)
r=bw;
g=bw;
b=bw;

if nargin >2
  rim = im(:,:,1)
  gim = im(:,:,2)
  bim = im(:,:,3)
end

if islogical(ind)
  f = find(ind);
else
  f = ind;
end

L = bwlabel(bw);

for i=1:length(f)
  ob = (L==f(i));
  r(ob) = 1;
...
```

```
bwlabel(bw) %Each blob in different color
```

Now show the thing who passed the test

![](ex_4.jpg)

Now we want 
` ind = a > 50 & a <50000 & e<0.7`

![](ex_5.jpg)

Solidity test
` ind = a > 50 & a <50000 & e<0.7 & s>0.7`
