## Lecture 2. Human perception

How Humans perceive color
- **Cornea**, clear durable part, to protects you from germens also it contributes as a fixed lens.
- **Pupil**, it's a moving window.
- **Iris**, is the muscle who contracs/expands to controls the aperture of the pupil.
- **lens** (crystalline), biconvex lens who can change shape used to focus light. When op
- **retina**, Nerveous tissue sensitive to light (rods and cones). 
- **Fovea**, central part of the retina, where the color sensitive cells (cones) reside
- **Optic Nerve**, The wire of information towards the brain, (region without sensitive cells)
Notes:
- The Fovea is just 1.5mm square with 350k color sensitive cells. 
- A 24 megapixels at 24mmx16mm chip size, you would have 62500 pixels
Digital Cameras Sensor size:
- Full frame, 36mm x 24mm 
- APS-C, 22mm x 15mm
- Micro Four Thirds, 17mm x 13mm
- One-inch sensor, 13.2mm x 8.8mm
- Compact, 11mm x 11mm

Brigthness
- Brightness is logarithmic as a function of incident intensity
- Iris can adapt the brightness adaptively
Dynamic Range (highest brightness/ darkest brightness)
- Eye: O(10^10)
Sensitivity (small changes in intensity)
- do you percieve the dot from the background?
