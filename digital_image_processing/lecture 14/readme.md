# Lecture 14: Image segmentation continuation

Instead of dealing with Pixel level segmentation, we are about to deal with curved level segmentation.
- The idea is to segment curves, not pixels.
- The convex hull evolves shrinking like a rubber band

Its an iterative process, we want a segmentation curve that.
1) Conforms to Image Edges
2) Is a smoothly varying curve vs lots of jagged rooks and crannies Tradeoff

What is a good curve? Define a cost function.
