# Lecture 14: Image segmentation continuation

Instead of dealing with Pixel level segmentation, we are about to deal with curved level segmentation.
- The idea is to segment curves, not pixels.
- The convex hull evolves shrinking like a rubber band

![](active_contour_1.jpg)
![](active_contour_2.jpg)


Its an iterative process, we want a segmentation curve that.
1) Conforms to Image Edges
2) Is a smoothly varying curve vs lots of jagged rooks and crannies Tradeoff

What is a good curve? Define a cost function.
How to define a curve.

# Snakes
Parametric representation of a curve.
- A function of X(t) and a function of Y(t). as we change t\in[0,1] we trace a contour in the plane.
- We assume X,Y and t are continuous.

![](parametric_curve.jpg)

- Now we want to define an Energy function $E(C)$, where C is a curve, that matches an intuition of how well our curve is.
- The curve will iteretarively evolve to reduce / minimize $E(C)$.

We descompose $E(C)$ into 2 parts

![](energy_curve.jgp)

- $E_{internal}$ only depends on the shape of the curve
    - Can be thought as Tension Energy, the higher the squigglyier
    - Or the Elastic Energy of the curve
    - The first term (first derivative or speed) is related to how stretchy a curve is. Sampling the curve leads you to close points.
    - The second term (second derivative) low C'' means not too 'bendy'. Keeps points on the curve from oscilating.

- $E_{external}$ depends on image intensities (Edges)
    - What makes a curve good externally?
    - Final curve should basically lie in top of strong edges of the image

![](energy_curve_3.jpg)

NOTE: Assuming Image is grayscale
- If there is no edge, then its gradient is zero
- If i have a big edge, then $||\nabla I|| is big, meaning $E_{ext}$ lower energy (negative)
    
Intuition is that I want the snake being attracted to edges
    
### How to Minimize E(c) via variational calculus?

Finding the Curve function, which minimize its Energy.
- In practice we solve the problem by creating a curve $C(s,t)$ with $s, t$ discrete.

![](energy_curve_4.jpg)

![](energy_curve_5.jpg)

In practice, this results in a $2K \times 2K$ linear system solved at each iteration.
- lot of tips under the hood.
- You may want to resample the curve to uniform points

#Matlab: SNAKE ALGORITHM

It is not always robust

![](energy_curve_10.jpg)

Problem with basic snake 
- Flat regions (white or black) have $E_{ext}=0$ 
- Contour never sees strong edges that are far away
- Image noise implies small gradients hunging up the snake

The solution is **Gradient Vector Flow** (GVF)

Idea:
- Instead of using exactly the image gradient, create a new vector field over image plane

![](gradient_vector_flux_1.jpg)

so $v$ is defined to minimize:

![](gradient_vector_flux_2.jpg)

Where $||\nabla e||^2$ is basically the magnitud of the edge map

Where $||v - \nabla e || ^2 is basically saying, how similar is the thing i'm creating $v$ to the thing i want $\nabla e$

When i'm in a really edging region, then the $v$ i'm creating agrees with what's going on with the edges $\nabla e$.
- As Those terms are multyping, when $\nabla e$ is big, $v-\nabla e$ must be small.

Where $u$ is a tunning parameter who trades off how smooth is the vector field vs how close it is from the edges.

Intuition:
- If $\nabla e$ is big, gradient is large and $v$ is going to follow edge gradient faithfully.
- If $\nabla e$ is small, gradient is small and $v$ is following along to be as smooth as possible.
- $u$ trades off 'how smooth' vs 'how faithfull'

![](gradient_vector_flux_3.jpg)
![](gradient_vector_flux_4.jpg)

There are little vectors who normally would have zero gradient pushing toward the edge.

It doesn't work well with texturized background, 

also its slow
