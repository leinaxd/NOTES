# Lecture 15: Morphological Image Processing

We want to operate in a binary image. (i.e. after thresholding)

There might be some pixels that should be black and other ones that should be white.

Morpho = shape based processing.

Morphological operators takes a **set of pixels** and returns a **set of pixels**
- A set of pixels is a list of coordinates $(x_i, y_i)\ x,y\in Integer$

Key Element "**Structure element**" is a small template that helps produce the new image from the old one.

Translation Operation:

Reflection Operation:

Structuring element: small Binary Array

Erosion:
- Set of points $Z$ such that the Structure element (Strel) translated by $Z$ fits fully inside $A$

![](erosion.jpg)

Example of breaking the islands with 2 structure elements.

![](erosion_example.jpg)

```
#matlab STREL('disk',1)
[0 1 0]
[1 1 1]
[0 1 0]
#its not just a matrix, it has a center
```
In this exmaple, skinny lines doesn't fit the structure element, also it thickers the rest of the image
![](erosion_example_2.jpg)

So Erosion Removes thin lines, isolated dots. Is peeling away layers (edges)

## Dilation

Now we want to flatten out pixels

Erosion is always a subset of the image A

Dilation finds pixels such that shifted STREL has any overlap with the original set.

#matlab imdilate(im, strel)
```
