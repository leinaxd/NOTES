# Lecture 15: Morphological Image Processing

We want to operate in a binary image. (i.e. after thresholding)

There might be some pixels that should be black and other ones that should be white.

Morpho = shape based processing.

Morphological operators takes a **set of pixels** and returns a **set of pixels**

Key Element "**Structure element**" is a small template that helps produce the new image from the old one.
