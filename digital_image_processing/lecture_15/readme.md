# Lecture 15: Morphological Image Processing

We want to operate in a binary image. (i.e. after thresholding)

There might be some pixels that should be black and other ones that should be white.

Morpho = shape based processing.

Morphological operators takes a **set of pixels** and returns a **set of pixels**
- A set of pixels is a list of coordinates $(x_i, y_i)\ x,y\in Integer$

Key Element "**Structure element**" is a small template that helps produce the new image from the old one.

Translation Operation:

Reflection Operation:

Structuring element: small Binary Array

Erosion:
- Set of points $Z$ such that the Structure element (Strel) translated by $Z$ fits fully inside $A$

![](erosion.jpg)

Example of breaking the islands with 2 structure elements.

![](erosion_example.jpg)

```
#matlab STREL('disk',1)
[0 1 0]
[1 1 1]
[0 1 0]
#its not just a matrix, it has a center
```
In this exmaple, skinny lines doesn't fit the structure element, also it thickers the rest of the image
![](erosion_example_2.jpg)

So Erosion Removes thin lines, isolated dots. Is peeling away layers (edges)

## Dilation

Now we want to flatten out pixels

Erosion is always a subset of the image A
![](erosion_2.jpg)

Dilation finds pixels such that shifted STREL has any overlap with the original set.
![](dilation.jpg)

```
#matlab imdilate(im, strel)
```

![](dilation_example.jpg)

![](dilation_example_2.jpg)

Next, what we want are operators that bridge gaps/fill but don't change overall are of objects.

## Opening 

Erode, then dilate.
- Break narrow bridges
- Eliminate thin structures

![](opening.jpg)

![](opening_example.jpg)

## Closing

Dilate, then erode.
- Fuses narrow breaks
- Eliminates small holes

![](closing.jpg)

![](closing_example.jpg)

In this example, the first image is the original fingerprint, the second is eroded with ```strel('diamond', 1)```, and the third is closed with ```strel('square', 3)```

![](example_3a.jpg)
![](example_3b.jpg)
![](example_3c.jpg)


There many combinations of Erosion, Dilation

## Boundary extraction

Take the original shape and erode by 1 pixel then substract ```xor``` that from the original shape.

![](boundary_extraction.jpg)

![](boundary_extraction_example.jpg)

Here we want to extract the hole or flood it.
- Starting inside the whole you keep dilating as long as you stay in that region

![](hole_extraction.jpg)

There are more morphological operators...

## Watershed transform

The idea is to reconstruct shape through ilumination.
Application: For counting blobs or disconnected shapes


Given a grayscale image, we think of this as a height map of ilumination.
![](watershed_1.jpg)

1. Find a local minima (lowest intensity value)
2. Punch a hole in each one
3. Start rising the water level from the bottom 1 unit at a time
4. Keep track of which points are asociated with which minima. (group through gradient)
5. At the point two basins are about to merge, build a single pixel "dam" to make it separate (list of pixels)
![](watershed_2.jpg)

![](watershed_3.jpg)

How is this related to morphological image processing?
- Lets revisit the flooding of 2 basins at time N.
- The flooding is a dilation operation which makes the basins a little bit bigger.
- So you keep flooding and building a wall as needed
- 'Floot at time N' all pixels which $I(x,y)<N$
![](watershed_4.jpg)
![](watershed_5.jpg)

The inverse process is also available
- Given a binary Image, you want to convert to a gray scale image.
- What is the furthest distance that any pixel is from a given value point
- The closer to the boundry the lower its value
- Once you have the gray scale image you can plot apply the watershed algorithm

![](watershed_6.jpg)
![](watershed_7.jpg)
![](watershed_8.jpg)

For example, if you have an image of cells made from different blobs, you want to count the number of cells.
