# Lecture 29: Active Shape Models

The topic of today is a computer vision problem called 'active shape models'
- So far we've studied the low level of images, computing gradients, connecting edges into lines
- We didn't understood what's really going on in the image
- This lecture is about image understanding or computer vision.

Active Shape Models is a different type of object detection.
- for example, licence plate detection.
- Not template based.


Template base object runs a patch over the image.
- For example a plate over the car image.

That work pretty well for rigid object (they don't change in size)


If you are searching for faces instead, many people have different face features. 
- So this will be usefull for not rigid shapes.

![](2_vision.jpg)

For this to work i need to collect many faces.
- i need to manually assign points to define the face.
- we are trying to find common locations that i can put into correspondance 
 
![](3_vision)


IDEA:
- Given an image and a mask
- Using a convlutional neural net to search the car plate over the image,
- The mask is telling you the right object position. The true target.
- The task of the neural net is to predict a binary mask for the location of the plate.

### Procrustes Analysis
Greek myth, he was a bandit, he would tie his victims to an iron bed and he would chop off their limbs or stretch them so they fit to bed.
- Scale and stretch

The first thing to do is to scale, rotate and translate each set of points. 
- So the first problem is alignment

Algorithm 1
1. Translate all shapes to be centered at (0,0)
2. Now take one of the shapes $Z^1$, and we are going to scale it, so it has length 1 $||Z^1|| = 1$
3. Scale and rotate everything else (all other shapes) to align with this shape

For each person $a^i$ i'm going to compute the vector for person j and the vector for peson 1.

![](5_vision.jpg)

Then do some manipulations between the X and Y coordinate for person 'j' respect to person 'i'

![](6_vision.jpg)

The magic formula is 
- This is telling me how to scale and rotate person 'j' to align to person number 1
  
![](7_vision.jpg)


My new values for person 'j' will be scale and rotate.


![](8_vision.jpg)


So now, we have $S$ sets of aligned Training sets.

Each of them is described by a 2n-vector of feature points.

### Principal Component Analysis  (PCA)
Clearly these 2n points are not all independant
. I can exploit that correlation

So we want to reduce the dimensionality of this set of vectors $Z$ to a number $K<< 2N$
- Many dimensions are hard to visualize, consider then a cloud of points in 2D
- Along the line is the directions which the data varies the most.
- And the perpendicular is the direction which data isn't varing at all

![](9_vision.jpg)

This also can be seen as a change of coordinates.
- if i only give you one number, i can give you the projection of each point in the new coordinated system.
- If i have to give you just one coordinates i will give you the one who minimizes the error

![](10_vision.jpg)

Algorithm of PCA:
1. Compute Mean of data as $\mu = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^S z^i \ \in\ 2n\times1$
2. Compute the covariance Matrix of data as $\Sigma=\frac{1}{s-1} \sum_{i=1}^s (z^i-\mu)(z^i-\mu)^T\ \in\ 2n\times 2n$
    Note, the term $\frac{1}{s-1}$ is what to make to the estimator unbiased for gaussian distribution
3. Compute Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors of $\Sigma$, $(\lambda_i, v_j)$ such that $\lambda_1 \le \lambda_2 \le.. \sum v_j = \lambda_j v_j$
   Lambda is telling me how important is that direction $v_j$.
4. Compute Total Variance $T=\sum_{j=1}^s \lambda_j$

It turns out i don't need that many eigenvectors at all.

5. I can choose the K largest eigenvalues, to account for the $p%$ of the total variance.
   $\sum_{j=1}^K \frac{\lambda_j}{T} \geq 0.99$

Now we can approximate any of the original shapes $Z$ as 

![](11_vision.jpg)

Now i can specify any shape with K numbers by adding up the mean and b.

If i plot the data in the new coordinates i discover that i don't really need the second axis.

![](12_vision.jpg)

The K-dimensional vector **b** defines a small number of parameters for the deformable shape model.

For example, i can have 40 people, with 100 parameters, and i boiled up to just 3 parameters.


This is a demo of shape detection
- The blue dots are maybe the x-y positions of the feature points.
  
![](13_vision.jpg)

As i tune the values of **b** i get different face expressions.

![](14_vision.jpg)

So what i do is choosing the right orientation to match the mask

![](15_vision.jpg)
![](16_vision.jpg)

The mask starts in some random position and then kind of snaps into the face.


What you find is that the mask automatically follows the person's face.

![](17_vision.jpg)


So how do you actually snap the mask to a person's head.


Choosing **b** corresponds to a candidate shape. 
The small set of values from the **b**-vector are like "knobs" we can turn to get the best fit.

The mods (eigenvectors) $v_i .. v_k$ are often intuitive. (for faces they may correspond to $\lambda_1$ for smile, or $\lambda_2$ shaking its head)

The following question is, how do i take my model (knobs) and fit them to an actual new image.
- if you think about this, there's no pixel intensities manipulations.
- i was just choosing locations in my image.

so now i have to figure how to snap that into the person.

### FITTING THE MODEL TO NEW DATA
