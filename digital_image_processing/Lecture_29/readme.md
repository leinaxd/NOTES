# Lecture 29: Active Shape Models

The topic of today is a computer vision problem called 'active shape models'
- So far we've studied the low level of images, computing gradients, connecting edges into lines
- We didn't understood what's really going on in the image
- This lecture is about image understanding or computer vision.

Active Shape Models is a different type of object detection.
- for example, licence plate detection.
- Not template based.
