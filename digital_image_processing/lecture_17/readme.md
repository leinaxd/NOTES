# Lecture 17: Object and Feature Detection
Up to this point we talk about how to get primitives
- Lines
- Use Sobel Edge detector to find edgy points
- And use Hough transform to connect those edgy points with straight lines
- How to use morphological image processing
- How to use Binary image processing to find those points or lines around the boundary

But how do i detect specific objects in the image?
- if i want to detect faces or chairs
- How to go from the low level stuff to higher levels
- Today we will overview how those kind of processes work
