# Lecture 20: Image Restoration and the Wiener filter
How to improve the visual quality of an image
So far we've talked about
- Low pass filtering (avg to remove gaussian noise)
- Median filtering (to remove salt and pepper noise)
- Unsharp masking to enhance details

Today we will talk about a method to automatically undo the corruption done to the image

Basic model of degradation
- Given an Image
- it goes through some degradation filter (point spread function H) (linear like blunder)
- next we are going to add some noise
- what comes out is a degraded image
  
![](1_image_restoration.jpg)

what's we are going to do is 
- put the degraded image to some restoration filter

![](2_image_restoration.jpg)

In spatial domain vs frequency domain

![](3_image_restoration.jpg)

Easier case is when there's no degradation filter. Just random noise.
- Noise is described through its PDF
  
![](4_image_restoration.jpg)

Noise may be due to 
- non ideal sensor elements
- Environemntal conditions (light level, temp)
- Corruption during transmission/compression (i.e. jpeg)
- We assume noise to be I.I.D. 


Gaussian Noise 
- Thermal noise, Sensor noise
  
![](5_image_restoration.jpg)

Rayleigh
- Range imaging (radar)
![](6_image_restoration.jpg)

Exponential 
- Laser imaging
  
![](7_image_restoration.jpg)

Salt and Pepper
- Probability of white /black
- Delta functions
  
Uniform

![](8_image_restoration.jpg)

Also you can have periodic Noise or Correlated Noise

![](9_image_restoration.jpg)

Its 2D Fourier Transform is

![](10_image_restoration.jpg)

There are some frequencies out of place.

![](11_image_restoration.jpg)

Periodic Noise (non-iid) manifest as unusual peaks in the FFT
- can be removed through notch filter
- Or high pass filter

![](12_image_restoration.jpg)
![](13_image_restoration.jpg)

![](14_image_restoration.jpg)
![](15_image_restoration.jpg)

How to determine what kind of noise is present
- You can select some flat region
- Analyze the PDF of that region

![](16_image_restoration.jpg)
![](17_image_restoration.jpg)

Histogram of the flat region
- A gaussian has been fitted to that histogram
  
![](18_image_restoration.jpg)

Other model of noise could be possible, in our case gaussian fits well

![](19_image_restoration.jpg)

You can't substract noise
- in the IID case, there's no much we can do beyond we already know
- Mean filter
- Median filter

![](20_image_restoration.jpg)

How agressive should be my filter?

### **Adaptive Filter**
Changes depending on the noise characteristics in a local window around the pixel

Suppose we know: 
- The corrupted image
- The noise variance across the entire image
- We can estimate the local mean around the pixel
- and the Local variance

![](21_image_restoration.jpg)

A way of doing reconstruction is taking the corrupted image minus that term.
- Decision comparing the local noise variance to what i think is locally added to the image

![](22_image_restoration.jpg)


If local variance is zero, the reconstruction image is the corrupted image
If the local variance is bigger than the global variance, then my estimated output is close to my estimated input.
- High local variance means an edge, we want to preserve edges
If the local variance is about the same my global variance, that means that my estimated output is basically the mean.
- Avg intensities in kind of normal regions
  
![](23_image_restoration.jpg)


We need an estimate of the global variance to this method to work.
- Like using the flat region characteristics

`wiener2()`


In the left the original image, in the right the wiener filter.

![](24_image_restoration.jpg)

Compared with applying a smoothing filtering
- Left is wiener filter, righr is smoothing filter
  
![](25_image_restoration.jpg)


### What happens when we also have degradation
How to estimate the blur? $H(u,v)$
- i have not access to the original image.
  
![](26_image_restoration.jpg)

Guessing, take a piece of the degraded image and guess what the original image should have looked like

- Look at the fourier transform of a **Guess Area** and compare it with our manual guess

![](27_image_restoration.jpg)

Experimentation
- if you have access to the imaging device
- Directly adquire the impulse response (dark room with a pinhole of light) (point spread function)

Estimate or model $H(u,v)$ (i.e. gaussian noise)


Here we have luck capuring a star

![](28_image_restoration.jpg)


### Inverse Filtering 
so,
- we have a degraded image, $\hat{I}(x,y)$
- we have the estimated blur, $H(x,y)$ (the star cropped from the original image is the impulse response H)

Then apply the inverse filter of the blur

![](29_image_restoration.jpg)

However this process doesn't work in real life,
