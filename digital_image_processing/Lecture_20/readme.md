# Lecture 20: Image Restoration and the Wiener filter
How to improve the visual quality of an image
So far we've talked about
- Low pass filtering (avg to remove gaussian noise)
- Median filtering (to remove salt and pepper noise)
- Unsharp masking to enhance details

Today we will talk about a method to automatically undo the corruption done to the image

Basic model of degradation
- Given an Image
- it goes through some degradation filter (point spread function H) (linear like blunder)
- next we are going to add some noise
- what comes out is a degraded image

what's we are going to do is 
- put the degraded image to some restoration filter

In spatial domain vs frequency domain

Easier case is when there's no degradation filter. Just random noise.
- Noise is described through its PDF

Noise may be due to 
- non ideal sensor elements
- Environemntal conditions (light level, temp)
- Corruption during transmission/compression (i.e. jpeg)
- We assume noise to be I.I.D. 


Gaussian Noise 
- Thermal noise, Sensor noise

Rayleigh
- Range imaging (radar)

Exponential 
- Laser imaging

Salt and Pepper
- Probability of white /black
- Delta functions
  
Uniform

Also you can have periodic Noise or Correlated Noise
