# Lecture 24: Digital Watermarking

Related terms:
- Cryptography. Having some clear information, Encrypt it with a key and get some useless information that can only be undone with the key
  
![](1_watermarking.jpg)

- Steganography: embedding a secret message into an innocent cover object. (hide the fact the communication is happening at all)

- Watermarking is in-between: Embed information into an image so that:
1. Image seems unchanges
2. Watermark can be extracted even after prccessing
3. Remaining watermark should destroy the image.

## Watermarking
Its name comes from watermarks on paper (fancy tissue paper)

![](2_watermarking.jpg)

If you want to buy this image i will undo those watermarks.

![](3_watermarking.jpg)

The content provider is trying to corrupt the image so you can't undo the process.

It happens in tv shows too.

![](4_watermarking.jpg)

The watermark is semi-transparent so you can't undo the watermark that easily.
- you don't want to show your watermark that easily.
- you will try to hide that mark once the movie starts. (its in there but you don't know where)


Another example
- five dots that appears in a lot of currencies
- This prevents you from making color photocopies of currency.
- A high quality scan, the printer will give you a dark area
  
![](5_watermarking.jpg)

![](6_watermarking.jpg)

High end color printers have these patterns of yellow dots.
- they encode the serial code and the serial number of the printer 

![](7_watermarking.jpg)


Insertion or Embedding

![](8_watermarking.jpg)

If you are the content creator and you want to proove that its your property
- You want to prove the authenticity of that copy

![](9_watermarking.jpg)


Before posting your image in flickr-or facebook, you want to keep the authenticity of that copy.

- we  don't want placing the metadata in the header that can be manipulated. you want to embed the mark into the data.

### Desirables properties of a watermark
- visualy imperceptible
- Statistcally imperceptally (not changing the mean of variance of the pixels)
- Robust to either inadvertant or intentional attacks

Techniques
- Cropping, resizing, compression, enhancement, rotation,
- Print the image in high quality and rescan
- Collusion (if we buy a couple of copies, and we average those copies we dilute each individual mark so it looks anything marked when i send it out)
- Random Noise attack
  
- Alternative Fragile. The watermark breaks as soon the image is modified. (Used in forensics)
- 
Ab Issue is 
- High capacity, how much information can i embed
- Speed, don't want to take forever to place or detect the watermark

### 1. Spatial Watermark

You can probably undo this process.

![](10_watermarking.jpg)

### 2. Mark the least significant bits of the image
Divide the original image by 4, and add to the watermarking
  
![](11_watermarking.jpg)

- It's extremely easy to remove. just cut the last 2 least significant bits.
- Not robust to noise
- Useful for printed images
  
### Pseudo random noise
Encode the watermark.
- split the image into blocks
- Define 2 pseudorandom noise patterns $w_0$, $w_1$ same size as blocks
- To encode bit K, $I_w(block\ k)\ =\ I(block\ k) +\alpha * W_k $
If i want to encode a cero, add a bit of w_0, if i want to encode a 1, then use the other pseudonumber generator.

Decode the watermark
- split image into blocks
- correlate each block with $W_0$ and $W_1$, extract bit K corresp to higher correlation.

So a marked document will give you a high correlation while the unmarked one should give you totally random.

Not robust
- It's still sensitive to cropping and scaling. You loose the correct edges.

## FREQUENCY DOMAIN WATERMARKING

Most effective watermarking algorithms opperate in the frequency domain.
- Hide information in the frequency domain.
- In the DCT we can change coefficient without changing our perception of the image.

The idea is to hide information in the important visual frequency bands.
- so you cannot remove it through a passband filter.



### Simple Frequency flipping method (block-based)
- Choose 2 DCT coefficient locations that are expected to have almost the same average values / ranges.

In Jpeg 
![](12_watermarking.jpg)


For every 8x8 block, compute the DCT C(u,v)
- if the C(4,1) location is greather than the C(2,3) location, then code as 0.
  
![](13_watermarking.jpg)

Then if coefficients don't already match w, then flip them.

Not robust
- If the attacker knows how this works, he can undo the process.

### A more robust approach by cox et all.

Encoding,
1. Compute DCT of entire image
2. Find K largest magnitude coefficients $c_1...c_k$, not include DC.
3. Watermark is K-length random vector $w_1 .. w_k ~ N(0,1)$
4. Embed the watermark

![](14_watermarking.jpg)

5. Replace $c_i$ with $c_i'$ and take IDCT

Decoding
1. Compute DCT of the entire image
2. Extract K coefficients in the know locations (side-information)

$\hat{c_1} ... \hat{c_k}$

3. Compute, 

![](15_watermarking.jpg)
(arrows shows the side information)

4. Compute

![](16_watermarking.jpg)

It turns that these number, is shown to be normally distributed under some assumptions

If that number is greather than 6, then this normal random variable is greather than 6 deviation from the mean.

This number is telling you how likely those numbers are. (correlation)

5. Threshold last number to make decision.



### Example
Original image

![](17_watermarking.jpg)

- Specifying how many cosine coefficients i'm going to flip, and the strength $\alpha$ of the watermark.
```
%matlab embed function
function [out, ind, cw,w] = embed(im, k , alpha)

[m, n] = size(im);
d  = dct2(im);
dvec = d(:);

[c,ind] = sort(abs(dvec, 'descend'));
ind = ind(2:k+1);
cw =  dvec(ind);

w  = randn(k,1);
ci = cw.*(1+alpha*w)

dvec (ind) = ci;

dhat  = reshape(dvec, [m, n]);
out = uint8(idct2(dhat));
```

```
%matlab detect function
function gamma = detect(test, ind, cw, w, alpha)

d = dct2(test);
dvec = d(:);

testc = dvec(ind);

what = ((testc./cw)-1)/alpha

%if using cross correlation
% g = corrcoef(what, w);
% gamma = g(1,2);
% gamma(isnan(gamma)) = 1;

gamma = (what' *w) / norm(what) %Gamma is the threshold
```


Lets try it

```
wim = embed(im, 1000, .1)
```

They look pretty much the same.

![](18_watermarking.jpg)

computing the difference
```
d = double(im - wim)
average (d(:))

--> 2.399

max(d(:))

---> 26

imshow(d,[])
```

So i'm not changing any bit too much

Where are those differences?

![](19_watermarking.jpg)


If now i'm going to detect
```
[wim, ind, cw, w] = embed(im, 1000, .1)

detect(wim, ind, cw, w, .1)

--> 31
```

The result is a big number, meaning the watermark is in there.
The threshold is set to 6.


### Now lets try to make list of ways to screw the image

```
function [out, names] = attack (im)

[m, n] = size(m)

names{1} = 'contrast stretch';
out{1} = imadjust(im);

names{2} = 'Histogram equalization';
out{2} = histeq(im);

names{3} = 'Drop least significant bits';
out{3}   = 4*(im/4);

names{4} = 'Enlarge/shrink';
out{4} = inresize(imresize(im, 1.3), [m,n]);

names{5} = 'Shrihk/enlarge'
out{5} = imresize(imresize(im,.5), [m,n])

names{6} = 'Crop/Noise'
out{6} = imresize(im(5:end-5, 5:end-5), [m,n])

names{7} = 'Low Noise';
out{7} = imnoise(im, 'gaussian',0,0.001);

names{8} = 'Heavy Noise';
out{8} = imnoise(im, 'gaussian',0,0.05);

names{9} = 'Jpeg moderate compression';
imwrite(im, 'temp.jpg', 'quality', 50);
out{9} = imread('temp.jpg');

names{10} = 'High compression';
imwrite(im, 'temp.jpg', 'quality', 25);
out{10} = imread('temp.jpg');

```


Now lets apply all these attacks to our watermarked image

```
[at, names] = attack(wim)

attackshow(at, names)

attackreport(im, 1000, .1)
```

```
function attackshow(out, names)
for i=1:length(names)
  imshow(out{i})
  title(names{i})
  pause
end
```

```
function out = attackreport(im, k, alpha)

[out, in, cw, w] = embed(im, k, alpha);
diff = double(out) - double(im);
diff = diff(:);
disp('-------------------------)
disp(['Average difference:' , num2str(mean(diff)) ]);
disp(['Maximum difference:' , num2str(max(diff)) ]);

[attacked names] = attack(out)
```

Original image
- avg diff = 0.003
- max diff = 19

Contrast stretch
- detection score: 23.361

![](20_watermarking.jpg)

Histogram equalization
- detection score: 10.55
![](21_watermarking.jpg)

Drop least significant bits
- detection score: 31.84
  
![](22_watermarking.jpg)

Enlarge/Shrink
- detection score: 30.13
  
![](23_watermarking.jpg)

Shrink/Enlarge
- it should be a little bit blurried than before, because of pixel interpolation
- detection score: 31.83
  
![](24_watermarking.jpg)

Crop resize
- detection score: 7.61

Adding up low noise
- detection score: 31.586
  
![](25_watermarking.jpg)


Adding lot of noise
- detection score: 17.25
  
![](26_watermarking.jpg)

Moderate compression
- detection score: 31.77
  
![](27_watermarking.jpg)

Heavy compression
- detection score: 31.59
![](28_watermarking.jpg)

10x collusions
- detection score: 9.67
- take 10 different watermarks and average to dilute the mark

The watermark has survived all the attacks.

- you can still make the mark a little bit stronger

A strong watermark cloud can be viewed at the bottom left corner of the image

![](29_watermarking.jpg)

The payload is usually low, because the watermark is strong.

![](30_watermarking.jpg)


Collusion attack where you average the image from the same sources is the dangerous one, however this method still works fine.
