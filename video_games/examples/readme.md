Notes of games
1. Manifold garden
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IuErL1hJhQ
  
    - In the tutorial (ugly part), it spoilers the environment, so you will be longing for what is coming.
    - Mechanics of rotating the room, matches with the Escher's drawings.
    - Gravity manipulation device 
    - Contrains that you cannot jump
    - Simple aesthetics, glowing lines as feedback when you achieve something. Without the glowing there's no point in moving around
    - Ambient noise with eco
    - Infinite scenario, infinite stars. However if you fall you get exactly where you werea
    - Confusion vs Aha! moment
  
2. The talos principle

    - Named the levels
    - shiny trophies
    - A few Super realistic objects in a low def world
    - Long walkthrough, lots of puzzles seems as work. There's lot of redundancy. Each level should show a mechanic and move on.
    - Back-in-time button to rewind last bad move
    - History ghosts to spook you, so the game comes alive
    - Storytelling: 1. Religious deep Impact. 2. notes from others players
