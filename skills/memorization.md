    1. Build a mental Palace. A familiary place you know well like your house.
        (also the bus stop path, streets you know well)

    3. Define a traversal path
        - Front door (First room)
        - Garage 
        - Corridor
        - Kitchen
        - Bedroom
        - Bathroom

        - Stairs
        - Bathroom
        - Room
    4. Imagine something is happening about that room and that object
        - Starting in the front door full with toy balls, you feel uncofortable.
        - Next room is the Garage, there's lot of scissors, you cannot walk without hurting yourself
        - In the Corridor, there's lot of lollipops, everything is sticky everywhere
        - In the Kitchen, first thing you see is a guy with a screwdriver breaking absolutely everything.
        - Going inside that bedroom you find that instead of a bed there is a huge hat.
        - you go then to the bathroom and find a lot of drinks & cocktails everywhere. 
        - You go to your Back Garden, and found lots of ties in the floor, hanging in the walls growing from the soil.
        - In the stairs you found a guy cutting the electricity with a butcher knnife.
        - You go throught the upstair-bathroom and found all your favorites t-shirts soaked at your Bathtub.
        - You got hungry at your final room and the you found your drawers full of Lemons.
